# --Introduction--

In this Prosper Loan EDA Analysis project, we delve into a comprehensive exploration of loan data from Prosper, uncovering valuable insights that shed light on borrowing trends, risk factors, and lending dynamics. Through meticulous data analysis and a meticulously crafted Excel dashboard, we present a concise visualization of key findings, empowering informed decision-making in the realm of lending and investment.

# --Problem and Aim to Solved--

The problem addressed in this project is to decipher the influential variables affecting loan outcomes and borrower risk within Prosper's lending platform. The aim is to construct a clear, data-driven understanding of these factors, aiding lenders in making prudent lending decisions and borrowers in optimizing their loan requests

# --Methodology--

The methodology involves sourcing the Prosper Loan 2022 dataset from Kaggle, followed by a rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing phase. Subsequently, an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to unearth patterns and insights. Finally, an interactive Excel dashboard is crafted, effectively visualizing the analyzed data and highlighting key trends and correlations for actionable decision-making.

# --Phases--

Data Collection: Acquire Prosper Loan data from Kaggle to serve as the foundation of the analysis.

Data Cleaning and Organization: Process and structure the data, addressing missing values and ensuring consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct a comprehensive analysis to unveil patterns, relationships, and insights within the dataset.

Excel Dashboard Creation: Develop an interactive dashboard in Excel, utilizing charts and graphs to visualize EDA findings.

Presentation Development: Compile the key insights and visualizations into a compelling presentation to effectively communicate the analysis outcomes.

# Insights

In 2003, there was a substantial increase in the number of loan applicants.

During the years 2007 and 2008, more than 60% of loan applications were received.

The average time required to complete loan repayment was 1.7 years.

The majority of the loans issued were categorized as small loans.

Most of the loan applicants were employed individuals.

A significant portion of borrowers' average monthly income came from self-employment.

Despite the high demand for loans and varied employment statuses, only 31% of the total loans issued were successfully recovered.


# Challenges Faced

Throughout the Prosper Loan EDA Analysis project, we encountered several notable challenges. First and foremost, the data cleaning and preprocessing phase presented complexities due to inconsistent data formats and missing values, demanding meticulous attention to detail.

The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) posed challenges in identifying meaningful patterns and correlations within a vast dataset, requiring advanced statistical techniques and domain expertise to interpret the findings effectively.

Creating an interactive Excel dashboard that effectively represented the complex EDA results and conveyed them concisely to users demanded a high level of data visualization and Excel skills.
